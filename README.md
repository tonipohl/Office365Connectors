# Office365Connectors
This sample web app shows how own business applications operate with Office 365 Connectors.
You need to have an Office 365 login to add an Office 365 connector to an Office 365 group you have permissions for.
The code has a callback function that shows the selected data of the user.
Once you have the endpoint URL, you can use this URL to send data to the Office 365 group.
That's it.
